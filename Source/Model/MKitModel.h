/**
 * Base model.
 *
 * This model will save/load its properties automatically.  By convention
 * any property prefixed with 'model' is not persisted.
 *
 * All models are stored within a graph which has one important side
 * effect you must be aware of: they will never be released or autoreleased
 * unless you explicitly remove them by calling their remove method.
 *
 * The graph is sort of like a global storage for models so that your
 * application isn't littered with different instances of the same object.
 *
 * For very large heirarchies, you might want to skip the graph.  In that case
 * implement the MKitNoGraph protocol to mark your model as a non participant.
